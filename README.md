## 📝 About Me.

Hi, I’m Ludiane! I’m currently transitioning into the tech world as a software developer. After exploring various fields, I decided to follow my passion for coding and am now a student at [Holberton School](https://www.holbertonschool.com/)

I’m diving into full-stack development, learning everything from C programming to web development and algorithms. I’m eager to use my skills to create meaningful solutions and am always open to collaboration and learning from others.

Let’s connect!

## 💡 Career Objective

My goal is to build a sustainable career in tech, where I can continuously learn and contribute to meaningful projects. I’m particularly interested in web development, Python programming, and working on solutions that benefit the community. Eventually, I aim to integrate my technical skills into creating innovative tools for real-world applications, such as automation, data analysis, and accessibility solutions.

In the long run, I also envision combining my career in tech with my entrepreneurial spirit to start projects that can make a difference in the world. Whether it’s through freelance opportunities, full-time positions, or building my own startup, I’m excited for the future.
